## 🧠 About the Challenge

The SQL Murder Mystery is a self-guided puzzle that requires you to:

- Investigate a fictional murder in SQL City
- Interrogate suspects using SQL queries
- Piece together clues using data from multiple tables
- Identify the killer based on the evidence

It’s an excellent test of SQL skills and Data Analysis involving:
- Filtering
- Joins
- Subqueries
- Aggregates
- Logical reasoning

## 🚀 My Approach

I solved the challenge using **SQLite** in a local environment. I started with the experienced prompt, analyzed the schema, and worked through the clues step-by-step entirely with SQL queries. My goal was to rely solely on SQL logic—no external notes or assumptions.
